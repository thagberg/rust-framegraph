06 July 2022 - Refreshing my memory on a lot of things. I had been working on the
shader cache, but it took me a while to figure out why I was working on that.
Currently, recreating the graph nodes is leaking descriptor sets and eventually 
will cause a panic when unble to allocate more. The new ShaderModule type uses 
SPIR-V reflection to build descriptor sets, descriptor set layouts, and the
pipeline layout, all of which are cached.
